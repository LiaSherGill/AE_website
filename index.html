          We call this tour the Archive Explorer Tour because the stories I'm going to tell you today have all been gleaned
          from the Tate archive. The archive for the whole of the Tate is here, in the lower levels of Tate Britain, and holds
          over a million items relating to the history of British art. It includes everything relating to an artists life
          including letters and sketchbooks as well as more unexpexted items that provide unique insights into the artist
          such as Francis Bacon's suitcase and model sailing ships belonging to Turner.

            <br>
            <em>Sir Henry Tate</em>
            <br>1898</h4>
            <br>
            What may be surprise you, considering we are in a gallery that bears his name, is that Henry Tate came from humble beginnings. He started work at a young age, around 13, as an apprentice in his brothers green grocers. He then set up a chain of grocer shops himself.
            <br><br>
            Now, at this time if you wanted some sugar you would go into a green grocers, be met with a young lad much like Henry, who would hack away at a large sugar loaf. You would then take it home, and hack away at it some more. There were two major problems with this process, one, obviously, the sheer inconvenience of it and secondly these sugar loaves often had other substances mixed into them. So the producers could save some money, other substances were mixed in so less pure sugar was used. In the worst cases, the substances were so toxic people died from consuming them.
            <br><br>
            While Henry is in Germany he comes across this new invention: the sugar cube. He buys a patent for it in the UK, and introduces the sugar cube to this country. You can imagine, what a revelation this would have been, customers could now guarantee that they would be buying pure sugar. And it made Henry's fortune.
            <br><br>
            What did he decide to do with all this money? Well, he did what a lot of moneyed men of his time did and became a philanthropist: such as giving money to build libraries. He also bought a lot of art. He filled his country home, in Streatham, full of contemporary British art. He would hold show Sunday's, were once a month on a Sunday the public were invited into the house to see his art.
            <br><br>
            Henry then decided he wanted even more people to see his art so he took his collection to the National Gallery. He asked for one stipulation: that above the door to the gallery it would say "Henry Tate Collection". And what did the National Gallery say? They said no. What was their reasoning? The official response was that the gallery didn't have enough space. However, there are a couple of other reasons why Henry may have been rejected. One, he was a self made man, an entrepreneur. At this time the majority of the art establishment (people who ran the National Gallery) were aristocracy, landed gentry, lords and ladies, from families with lots of wealth, unlike Henry. Another reason, is the type of art he collected. Henry collected contemporary British Art, including the pre-raphaelites, which was not held in high regard at the time. And we're going to find out more on our next stop, the 1840 gallery.

            <br>
            Here, in the 1840 gallery we can idea of what it would have been like for visitors who entered the gallery when it opened in 1897. The pantings in here are arranged on the wall in a way that is different to anywhere else in the gallery, and the same way they would have been seen in 1897. This way of arranging the paintings is called a Salon hang, for any of you who have been to the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition you’ll recognise it as it’s still the way they hang the paintings there.
            <br><br>
            The term Salon hang comes from the French, it was the way paintings were hung in the French art academies, and at this time when people thought of really good art they thought of the French. French and Italian painters were fashionable, not British painters such as those Henry collected and in particular not the pre-raphaelites. An important point to remember about Henry is that he wasn’t an expert in art, he purely collected what he loved not what was fashionable. Paintings such as Millais Ophelia, now the most famous painting in the gallery, was derided when first exhibited.

            <br> 1886 </h4>
            <br>
            Next I want to draw your attention to this painting in the corner, which is mostly overlooked but features in a very dramatic time in Tate history. In the late 1920s the Thames burst it banks. Now if you came in through the main entrance you would have seen how close we are to the river. When the banks burst the river water came rushing into the building and flooded the lower levels of the gallery. At the time these floors held the collection, all the paintings that were not on display. So, in the early hours of the morning there was an emergency rescue effort to save the works of art. Volunteers from the National Gallery and the V&A joined Tate staff in trying to save all they could. Even the director of the gallery, Charles Aitken, came to help out. And as he was wading through the sludge he stepped on something, so he plunged his hand into the water and pulled out this painting, Hope. Now, this would be a wonderful story if it wasn’t for the fact that this painting was Aitken’s least favourite painting in the whole of the collection.
            <br><br>
            Unlike Aitken, this painting is said to be favourite of Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela. Mandela had a reproduction of the painting with him in his prison cell in Robben Island. When I heard this I thought, it’s an interesting choice, because I looked at it and thought it’s quite a depressing painting isn’t it? But then I started looking a bit closer to try and see what he was seeing in it. The painting depicts the allegorical figure of Hope, she’s on this globe, playing the last string on her lyre and she’s blindfolded, with this gloomy, stormy sky around her. If you look at the very top of the canvas, there’s a tiny yellow spot of paint. A tiny star in this stormy sky. So, even though things seem rock bottom, in the distance there is this tiny star that signals better things to come. The hope that things will get better.
            <br><br>
            Now, I’ll leave it up to you to decide who you agree with, Charles Aitken or Nelson Mandela. But what this is a great example of is the way in which paintings can evoke different feelings in us.

            <br>
            We are now standing in the original building that opened in 1897. The original gallery was 4 rooms, two either side of the rotunda here and then doubled again.
            <br><br>
            This space is the location of one of my favourite stories from the archive. In the 1980s when surveying work was taking place in preparation for the Turner galleries, they were chipping away at some of the plaster as they were doing so they came across a piece of paper folder in the wall. When they unfurled it, this is what they read: [reads Plasterer’s Letter].
            <br><br>
            It turns out the Plasterers Association was indeed still flourishing and the Evening Standard took them out for a drink. What I love about this letter is that it gives us an insight into everyday working people at that time, and just like Henry, these working men wanted to leave a legacy, wanted to be remembered. They didn’t have the wealth and status to put their name to a building so instead they wrote this letter and hoped for the best.

            In here you can see materials from the archive reproduced, and throughout you will be able to spot the stories I spoke about in today’s tour.
            <br><br>
            Before we finish up, I want to talk to you about the history of this site, the history of the ground we are on. Before Henry Tate, before the idea of a gallery, this was the site of Milbank. This wasn’t any old prison, this was the largest prison in Europe and the brainchild of social reformer Jeremy Bentham. Bentham had an idea of how prisons could be reimagined, and he began with the architecture of the prison building. If you look at the tiles on the floor and the bench you are sitting on, this is the map of the prison, this type of layout is called a panopticon which comes from the Greek word meaning all seeing eye. For any Orwell fans, this is where big brother comes from. The idea was that in this central space, would be a watchtower where guards would watch the prisoners, who are in these petal shaped areas over here. With the prisoners constantly feeling as though they are being watched the idea was that they would adjust their behaviour themselves and then could be released back into society as moral citizens. However, Bentham’s hope did not become a reality and eventually the prison was deemed a failure. Disease was rife, there were outbreaks of cholera from prisoners drinking the river water and writers at the time such as Charles Dickens visited the prison and wrote about how awful the conditions were.
            <br><br>
            Before the prison was eventually demolished it was used as holding bay for prisoners sent to Australia. The prisoners were taken from the prison through an underground tunnel straight into the ships. It’s thought that the Australian word for English people “Pom”, comes from Prisoners Of Millbank.
            <br><br>
            You can see remnants of the prison in the surrounding area today, the bollard were the ropes from the ships were tied still stands outside and a couple of streets away you can see the prison moat.
            <br><br>
            They may seem like to complete opposites, a prison and then an art gallery. But I think there’s more in common there than what we might first think. Both were very typically Victorian projects in the betterment of society. Bentham wanted to reform prisoners and release them as law abiding citizens. Henry opened this gallery for free so that the public could enjoy his artwork and learn from it, educate themselves from it.
